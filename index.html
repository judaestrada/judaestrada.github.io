        I think anyone who has been harassed in any way thanks to homosexuality discrimination is an active member of this movement. 
        I consider myself male but I also want to help earlier gender movements become visible without repression.

    <h2>What do I think about HIV?</h1>
 
     <p>
         Answer: 
        It hurts me a lot to know that HIV is a disease that affects people from all over the world.
        They suffer a lot of discrimination and I think it is a very important thing to know.
        Something must be done to help accelerate the transition to a HIV discrimination free world.
